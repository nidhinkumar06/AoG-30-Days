# Basic Smart Home

If you want to create actions for the Smart Home you can do it using the API's provided for home where you can get the device details and pass it in the request like below

<div align="center">

</div>

Here the devices types will have details like whether it is vacum cleaner, thermostat and then in the device traits you will have more details

Instead of giving voice commands you can give the commands by touch.Even  you can get the report state for example if you lock a door and if the door is locked it should be shown in the view else the user would feel that the door is not locked which is not a good practice
