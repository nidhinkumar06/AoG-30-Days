# Pick the right conversational use case

Instead of making the user tap each screen we can use a single command to invoke/complete the task like below

<div align="center">
   <img src="../../assets/day6/savethe user.png" alt="user" height="300">
</div>

But there are some cases where we can't use voice assistants like if the user wants to buy a product based on reviews then it is hard to translate this things.

# Adapt to user's history with your action

Show the preference based on user's history for example if a new user comes to a coffee shop the attender will welcome him and tell him the menus.

When you become a regular visitor of the coffee shop the attender will serve you the same order based on your previous history

# Let's users speak naturally

Make users to speak naturally with your action make sure that there are no hiccups with your actions.

Consider the below example where an user can say yes in different types like below

<div align="center">
   <img src="../../assets/day6/different-ways-yes.png" alt="yes" height="300">
</div>

Once you have done with your grammars you can test your action with your friends

<div align="center">

</div>

Instead of handling everything we can use dialogflow like below

<div align="center">

</div>

System entities

<div align="center">

</div>

Machine Learning will extract the entities like below

# Use Context to get users unstuck

# Build for speakers then for screens

Design an action for voice first then create visuals for your actions

We can create a continued conversation for example if you get a notification on clicking the notification you can show that particular action/page

# Make your life easier with Helpers

You can use the pre-defined helpers which assistant provides. For example if you want to create an taxi action you can get the user location using the places api all the co-ordinates will created by google as well as the helpers will be handled by google

<div align="center">
   <img src="../../assets/day6/taxi-example.png" alt="taxi" height="300">
</div>

Available helpers

</div>

# Use account linking to personalize the experience

You can use account linking feature if your account need a signin with google. Example if you have a web application and a voice action where you want to track the user details you can do it using the account linking

<div align="center">
   <img src="../../assets/day6/accountlinking.png" alt="helpers" height="300">
</div>

To enable account linking you will be writing the code like below

<div align="center">

</div>

</div>

# Test with early adopters

Once your action is ready before going to deployment you can test your action and there are 2 set of way you can test your action like

* Alpha Testers
* Beta Testers

#### Alpha Testers

#### Beta Testers

</div>

# Boost Discovery

How to make your action to appear at the top in the directory as well as how to use the default intents like PLAY_GAME, GET_CRYPTOCURRENCY can be used with your action.

There is another option called app link where you can create a link of your action and you can use it anyhwere in websites/mobileapps/socialmedia

# Become a part of user's routine

How to make your users engaged and reengaged.

<div align="center">
   <img src="../../assets/day6/assistant-routines.png" alt="routines" height="300">
</div>

Users can set routines using a single command. You can make your action as routine

<div align="center">
   <img src="../../assets/day6/routine.png" alt="beta" height="300">
</div>

Rather than using routines you can use notifications for your actions
