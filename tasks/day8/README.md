# Voice Strategy and Design

Now it is the voice era where people would use their action to complete an action.
Some the design principles which you need to consider while creating an action as well as once an action is created and deployed it doesn't means that it is completed.

We should do iteration based on the users usage. It is a kind of process where we would keep on iterating the design based on the usage.

It is better to do the conversation at first as we have seen in the earlier videos which would make our action better.

# Enhancing Actions with API's like Machine Learning and Canvas

How we can use the Machine Learning API's in our action as well as how the Interactive Canvas gives a viusal appearance to your Actions in your smart display where we can use the Voice First approach.

As a beginner if you want to start with AoG go to the google assistant developer console and read the docs once it is done, try the codelabs for AoG.

Once you are confident enough you can try the Google Cloud API's like Machine Learning, Places API and check how you can integrate it with your action
